# RollnWrite — Project Guide

A SwiftUI iOS/iPadOS app that acts as a digital **scorecard** for roll-and-write
dice games (Qwixx, *That's Pretty Clever*, …). The first implemented game is
**Qwixx Big Points**. The app is a *pure scorecard*: you tap to cross out
spaces, the engine enforces the official rules strictly, and scores are computed
automatically. No dice are rolled in-app.

The codebase is deliberately built as a small **framework** so new games can be
added with minimal, isolated changes.

---

## Architecture & engineering principles

The app is layered. Dependencies point **inward**: `App` → `Games` → `Core`.
`Core` knows nothing about any specific game.

```
RollnWrite/
├─ App/                     App entry + game catalogue (composition layer)
│  ├─ RollnWriteApp.swift    @main; just hosts RootView
│  └─ RootView.swift         Catalogue UI, driven entirely by GameRegistry
├─ Core/                    Game-agnostic framework (reusable across games)
│  ├─ GameDefinition.swift   GameDefinition protocol + GameRegistry (extension point)
│  ├─ ScoringStrategy.swift  ScoringStrategy + TriangularScoring + Scoreboard
│  ├─ RulesDocument.swift    Rules content model + generic RulesView renderer
│  └─ Components.swift        Reusable cells/chips (MarkableCell, ScoreChip)
├─ Games/
│  ├─ Qwixx/                One game module
│  │  ├─ GameColor.swift          Colour/number model
│  │  ├─ QwixxModels.swift        Codable value types (ColorRow, BonusRow, state)
│  │  ├─ QwixxGame.swift          Engine: rules + transitions + persistence
│  │  ├─ QwixxBigPointsGame.swift GameDefinition + official rules text
│  │  └─ QwixxScorecardView.swift Scorecard UI (presentation only)
│  ├─ Clever/               "That's Pretty Clever" (Clever 1)
│  │  ├─ CleverModels.swift       Areas, colour theme, EXACT official layout data
│  │  ├─ CleverGame.swift         Engine: per-area structure + auto scoring + foxes
│  │  ├─ CleverScorecardView.swift Scorecard UI + dice-colour mapping
│  │  └─ CleverGameDefinition.swift GameDefinition + official rules text
│  └─ Clever2/              "Twice as Clever" (Clever 2)
│     ├─ Clever2Models.swift      Silver/yellow/blue/green/pink layout data
│     ├─ Clever2Game.swift        Engine: per-area scoring (manual foxes)
│     ├─ Clever2ScorecardView.swift Scorecard UI + dice-colour mapping
│     └─ Clever2GameDefinition.swift GameDefinition + official rules text
└─ Assets.xcassets
```

### SOLID, applied here

- **S — Single Responsibility.** Each type has one job: `QwixxModels` hold
  state, `QwixxGame` owns rules + transitions, `ScoringStrategy` does scoring
  math, the views only present. Rules *content* (`RulesDocument`) is separate
  from rules *presentation* (`RulesView`).
- **O — Open/Closed.** Adding a game means **adding** a `GameDefinition` and
  registering it in `GameRegistry.games` — no existing type is modified.
  `RootView` iterates the registry, so the catalogue and navigation extend for
  free. The Xcode target uses a *file-system synchronized group*, so new files
  under `RollnWrite/` are compiled automatically with **no `.pbxproj` edits**.
- **L — Liskov Substitution.** Every `GameDefinition` is interchangeable in the
  catalogue; `QwixxGame` conforms to the generic `Scoreboard` protocol and can
  stand in wherever a scoreboard is expected.
- **I — Interface Segregation.** Protocols are small and focused:
  `GameDefinition` (catalogue + view factory), `ScoringStrategy` (one method),
  `Scoreboard` (headline score + game-over + undo/reset).
- **D — Dependency Inversion.** `QwixxGame` depends on the `ScoringStrategy`
  abstraction and has a concrete strategy **injected** (Big Points = cap 15;
  classic Qwixx would be cap 12 — a constructor argument, not a code edit).
  `RootView` depends on `GameDefinition`, never on a concrete game type.

Patterns used: **Strategy** (scoring), **Registry/Factory** (`GameRegistry` +
`makeScorecardView()`), **type erasure** (`AnyView`) to keep a heterogeneous
game list, and a **LIFO command history** for exact, dependency-safe undo.

## How to add a new game (the OCP recipe)

1. Create `Games/<NewGame>/`. The synchronized group picks the files up
   automatically — no Xcode project edits.
2. Model its state as `Codable` value types (see `QwixxModels.swift`).
3. Write an engine: an `ObservableObject` that enforces the rules and conforms
   to `Scoreboard`. Inject a `ScoringStrategy` (reuse `TriangularScoring` or add
   a new conformer).
4. Provide a scorecard `View` (presentation only — never enforce rules in the
   view; ask the engine `canMark…`).
5. Add a `GameDefinition` (metadata + `RulesDocument` + `makeScorecardView()`).
6. Register it in `GameRegistry.games`. Done — it appears in the catalogue.

> Always use the **official** scorecard and rules for each variant. If they
> can't be sourced, ask before implementing — don't guess.

## Platforms & layout

- Universal: iPhone (all sizes) and iPad. Portrait + landscape.
- Deployment target: iOS 17.
- The scorecard sizes its cells with `GeometryReader` and caps the card width
  (700 pt) so it stays touch-friendly and centered on large/iPad screens.
  Verified targets include iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 15 Plus.

## Build & CI

- Open `RollnWrite.xcodeproj` in Xcode 16+ and run, or build via **Xcode Cloud**
  (shared scheme: `RollnWrite`). See `docs/XCODE_CLOUD.md`.
- The project uses `objectVersion = 77` (file-system synchronized groups);
  build with Xcode 16 or newer.
- **CI without a Mac:** `.github/workflows/ios.yml` builds the app on a
  GitHub-hosted macOS runner (iOS Simulator, no signing) on every push/PR. This
  is the no-Mac way to verify the project compiles; check it after each change.

## Game notes

**Qwixx Big Points** — strict marking, bonus crosses count for both adjacent
colours (cap 15 → 120). See `Games/Qwixx`.

**That's Pretty Clever (Clever 1)** — `Games/Clever`.
- All grid numbers, thresholds, multipliers, point scales and bonus/fox
  positions in `CleverModels.swift` (`CleverLayout`) were transcribed from the
  official Schmidt Spiele rulebook & score sheet (art. 88198). Treat that file
  as the source of truth; verify against the official sheet before changing.
- The engine enforces each area's *structure* (yellow/blue any-order single
  marks, green left→right, orange left→right with multipliers, purple strictly
  increasing with the after-6 exception) and computes every area score.
- **Foxes are auto-detected**: every fox sits at a row/column/reach-this-cell
  completion, and foxes only matter at scoring time, so the engine derives the
  fox count rather than asking the player to track it. Other bonuses (re-roll,
  +1, extra marks, coloured numbers) are applied manually — consistent with the
  pure-scorecard model (no in-app dice).
- **Dice-colour mapping**: players can remap the colour shown for each area to
  match their physical dice (`CleverColorTheme`). It changes only presentation,
  never scoring, and persists across games.

**Twice as Clever (Clever 2)** — `Games/Clever2`. Areas: silver (per-row
scale, summed), yellow (circle-then-cross, scored by crosses), blue
(descending-or-equal, scale to 78), green (6 pairs, each scores first−second
of die×multiplier), pink (sum). Layout in `Clever2Layout` is transcribed from
the official sheet (art. 88234). Foxes are a **manual stepper** here (their
triggers are spread across many area completions, unlike Clever 1 where each
fox is a single clean completion), each scoring the lowest area.

**Clever Cubed (Clever 3)** — `Games/Clever3`. Areas: yellow (3 rows, per-row
2/6/12/20/30/42), turquoise (5 rows, per-row 1/3/6/10/15/21), pink (sum) are
**auto-scored**; blue and brown use point tables printed only on the physical
score sheet, so those two totals are **entered by the player** (as the official
online calculator does) until the sheet is sourced. Foxes are a manual stepper.
The confirmed tables were cross-checked against the official scoring calculator.
No values were guessed — verify blue/brown against the official sheet before
converting them to auto-scoring.

**Clever 4ever (Clever 4)** — `Games/Clever4`. The most complex board
(polyomino grey area, coordinate blue area, three-rule yellow) with point
tables printed only on the physical sheet. Shipped as an honest **scorecard
calculator** v1: the player enters each of the five area totals; the engine
computes foxes (× lowest area) and the grand total, with dice-colour mapping.
Upgrade to an interactive board once the official sheet is transcribed — no
scoring values are guessed.

Do not generalise the Clever engines prematurely — each Clever has a
materially different board.

## Conventions

- Keep rule logic in engines, not views. Views ask `can…` and call mutators.
- Keep `Core` free of game-specific code.
- Persist game state via the engine (`UserDefaults` + `Codable`).
- Always implement from the **official** rules/scorecard; if unavailable, ask.
